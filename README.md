# CS3005-CW

## Game description
The player will control a knight whos mechanics at the start of the game include jumping, running and swinging a sword. The player will use these to progress through the levels. To attack, the player will click the RMB (Right mouse button). The attack will have a cooldown so the player cannot spam the move. The movement (WASD) will be very precise and not 'floaty', so once the player stops pressig 'A', then the character will stop moving straight away. Jumping will be done with SPACE, and will be a little 'floaty' but not too much. 

# Enemies 
* Blue - Takes one hit to kill. They move by jumping and once they touch the player, the player is damaged. 
* King Boss (Needs work) - Hardest to kill. Boss wil jump up and down towards player. He will switch to idle states randomly so player has some breathing room. He cannot be hurt by a normal swing attack, but can be hurt by the new projectile move the player will get in level 3.

## Game story (Subject to change)
A Knight takes on a contract from the Kings brother who has asked to find the kidnapped king. Witnesses say he was kidnapped by a green-looking creature. Before the Knight can take on this contract, he must upgrade his equipment. Once he is ready, the Knight enters the cave in which the monster is hiding. They fight, and the Knight is victorious. Right before the Knight was to claim his trophy, the monster shrinks to human size. The Kings brother comes rushing in with 20 of the Kings guards to see that the Knight had his sword to the Kings neck, and he was sentenced to die. The Knight thought about what had happened; the monster was already wounded; the Kings brother knew where the monster was hiding. He was put on the stool by the executioner and the rope was tied around the Knights neck. The Kings brother wanted the King dead in circumstances where he cannot be connected to the crime. Right before he could say anything, the stool was kicked from right under him and the Kings brother lifted his sleeve, to reveal green skin.

## Target audience
The target audience for the game is from ages 13 â€“ 16. This is mainly due to the story, which gets very dark towards the end because in the story. However, the look of the game is very simplistic, and child-like which will allow for younger ages to play the game. 

## Game rules
The player has 3 hearts meaning they can get hit up to 3 times before dying (4 times on level 3). If the player falls off a platform they die instantly and will be able to respawn back. The enemy damages 1 heart each time the player collides with it and the player can kill the enemies to get past them. Levels get more difficult as the game goes on, and the player will need to use the new mechanics they have acquired to pass the levels.

## Description of the digital media elements used within it
I created several sprites for my game: The Knight, King boss, enemy, spikes, executioner, Kings brother etc using pixel art in Photoshop. In addition to this, I also created animations on most of the sprites. I made several animations for several characters such as an idle, walk, attack animation for the Knight, boss, and enemy character. I did this using Photoshop to create multiple sprites which I connected in the animation tab to create seamless animations.
I also added sound effects/music into the game to make it move lively and interactable. I have chosen sound effects from other websites and added them to swinging a sword, hitting an enemy, background music for the game and so on.
