# CS3005-CW

## Game description
The player will control a knight whos mechanics at the start of the game include jumping, running and swinging a sword. The player will use these to progress through the levels. To attack, the player will click the RMB (Right mouse button). The attack will have a cooldown so the player cannot spam the move. The movement (WASD) will be very precise and not 'floaty', so once the player stops pressig 'A', then the character will stop moving straight away. Jumping will be done with SPACE, and will be a little 'floaty' but not too much. 

# Enemies 
* Blue - Takes one hit to kill. They move by jumping and once they touch the player, the player is damaged. 
* Goblins - Harder to kill, 2 - 3 hits and they attack by swinging their club around. 
* King Boss (Needs work) - Hardest to kill. Boss will move left and right swinging a sword around. The player can't really get close to boss, so they will have to use the new mechanic they acquired through the level to kill it. The boss may do a move that will require the double jump to not get hit for example. 

## Game story (Subject to change)
A knight takes on a contract from the kings right hand man stating that the king has been kidnapped by a monster of some sort. The knight accepts the contract and goes on his way to slay the beast. Before encountering the monster, the knight must prepare by upgrading some of his equipment as he knows he is not ready for the fight. This new equipment will give him new abilities that he once did not have that will give him the advantage in the fight to come. Once he is ready, he will enter the cave in which the monster hides. Once the knight sees the monster for the first time, he realises the monster is in fact the king himself, and the knight has no choice but to fight him. Once killed, monster returns back to normal human form, and the kings right hand man comes in to see that the knight has killed the king. Angry and upset, the kings right hand man sentences the knight to die.
